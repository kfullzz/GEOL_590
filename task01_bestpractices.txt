	Excel --> Formula --> Trace Dependence
		Track where the data for a particular cell comes from
	Group: Katie Sipes, Mariah, and Rachel
	Task 1:
		Read the posted powerpoints, 
Best Practices for Reproducible Data Analysis
	Repetition --> whether you do it again or someone else
	Limited by teh fact that there are so many different packages/software programs that can be used --> uniform
	Shared, pubilcally available respositories
	Deal with reproducing the data earlier on --> by the time you get to publication no one is going to go back and do it
	Diversity in tools that can be utilized amongst different disciplines/types of data
	Adpotion of common tools, standards, and procedures
	Development of community driven processes --> people contributing at different levels to better the product
	Version control systems (VCS)
		Ie Git --> store files in a respository, creates a log to track changes
		Linear or branched
		Allows for a "fingerprint" to be generated with each new iteration of the code
			Can compare fingerpritns to see where different version differ
				INTEGRITY
	Execution Automation
		Knowing that certain steps in analysis will depend on input from a previous one, you should be able to automate some of the steps including checking whether changes to previous files were made, thereby prompting reimplementation of the code
			This also applies to DVCS systems, where pulls can be automatically tested and a report put out so that any issues can be identified and adressed ASAP
	Comprehensive Testing
		Debugging ASAP
		Make sure to implement testing protocols at multiple steps
			Ie checking whether the input is what is expects to receive
			Unit tests --> ensure individual coding elements behave correctly
				Shift thinking from how code does something to what you want it to do
	READABILITY
		Consistent naming convetions
		Commenting
			Purpose, input/output, 
	Backups --> Synchronize/merge work between local and server locations
	Distributed Version Control
		Unlike VCSs, every respository contains the entire history of a project (not just on a single server)
			aka Automatic backups, can also merge cloned versions of projects if desired
	Interactive Environments
		Find platforms/interfaces that allow for all stages of the research cycle (initial exploration --> publication of data)
			This is important when you potentially need to switch between languages to perform different tasks of analysis
	Parallel Analyses!!! --> The importance of the cloud
Authors Conclusions of what's Required
	Sharing of software/data/knowledge
	Documentation of readable software that's tested and validated
	Increased computational literacy
	Collaborative development of open-source software tools
